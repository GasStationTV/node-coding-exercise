## Exercise Overview
The site - an individual gas station - is the most atomic piece of the GSTV business model - it is at the core of everything we do. Our hardware is installed at the site, advertisers purchase impressions at a site level and schedules are generated on a per-site basis. Thus, keeping accurate information about a site is essential to maintaining business operations.

We are asking you to build out the ability to create, edit and view hours for a given site. We are focusing on the way you approach the services, and structure the Mongo documents - there is no expectation of a polished UI.  **We want you to focus on the server-side aspects of implementing these requirements.**

This data is used to help us know when to turn on and off hardware, how many times a video asset is expected to play and at its most basic level, whether the site is open when we try to call them.

A site may have multiple open and close times for a single day. For example they may be open in the morning, but close mid-afternoon and reopen for the after work rush hour. In many cases stations will be open past midnight, but business owners do not necessarily think of this as the next day.

[Taco Bell](http://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bzl1SoxoBR-ggedVDlECAA/ls.jpg) is a perfect example of business hours vs. chronological hours  - they may be open until 4am on Sunday, but you still think of it as Saturday night.

#### Creating and Editing Hours
Edit & Create Site hours have the same business rules. The main difference is that on edit the dropdowns and values are prepopulated, while in add they are blank.

#### Extra Credit
##### Future Date/Time Open or Closed
Our field operations team often goes to sites for maintenance or upgrades. While creating their schedules it would be helpful to know if a site will be open on a given date and time in the future.

##### Timezones
GSTV has sites across the US. People from the Detroit main office may be calling sites in California. For that reason it is important to know the open times based upon a given timezone.

##### Daylight Savings Time
GSTV has sites in Arizona. Arizona does not participate in daylight savings time. For that reason it is important to know the open times based upon a siteâ€™s participation in daylight savings.

## System Requirements
* Node.js `^14.0.0`
* MongoDB `^4.0.0`

## Version Control
### GitFlow and GithubFlow
We use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/) on a daily basis - this allows us to build quality control into our development, QA and deployment process.

We are asking that you use a modified [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) - sometimes referred to as a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) - methodology instead of GitFlow. Conceptually, GitFlow and Github flow are similar.

Please fork our repository and use a feature branch workflow while developing your functionality. When you are ready to submit your work make a [pull request against our repository](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## JavaScript
### Standards
We have a work in progress [style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) that you can refer to. We don't expect you to strictly adhere to these standards, but they may help provide insight into how our JavaScript is generally structured.

### Unit Testing
Please feel free to create unit tests - we use [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).
