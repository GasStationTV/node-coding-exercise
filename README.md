Due to really limited time because of my current job requirements to be on call 24/7. I was only able to make a quick pass at this as I was dealing with a production server deployment for our scoring system. I was able to get the drop down display logic and day of week functionality partially going. You can see that I worked in an MVC pattern with different kinds of environment based configurations for deployments. I also completed the mongoose model structure of the time slot data. And began to leverage it for data save and search. Normally I would do all of this in angular and have useage of more verbs like PUT, DELETE, with JSON responses. But I wanted to get something up and running fast so I just did it old fashion POST style for the DOM creation. There was not enough time to finish the validation and complete the entire workflow but it was heading in the right direction. The drop down hour display logic was a fun challenge and that is in there. There are bugs in the View/Edit Page logic (It's really just incomplete). But at least it gives you an idea of some of my capabilities. I wish I had more time to work on this but I am completely slammed right now. My sincerest apologies and I hope that my attempt at it proves how eager I am to possibly work with you guys. 

All the best,
Robert Rudas
